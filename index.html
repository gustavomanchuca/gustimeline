          "I started learning web development at NUCBA, with the free time I have
          at the end of October and November 2023 , i learn HTML, GIT and CSS. I
          already had knowledge of these technologies, but it helped me to
          refresh my memory and practice again. With what I learned, I coded
          this web site as a timeline of my transformation from a private
          security employee on the night shift to becoming a professional web
          developer.""
